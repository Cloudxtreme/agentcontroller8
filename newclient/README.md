# AgentController2 Client #
A client library for speaking to AgentController from Go.

# How it works #
AgentController2 acts mainly as a relay for administrative commands sent from clients to connected Agent2 instances, and for 
responses back to the client from the targeted Agent2 instances.

# Usage #
*TODO*
